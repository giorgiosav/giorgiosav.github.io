[SFINAE](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae) is a Latin word
derived from the expression [_homo faber suae quisque
sfinae_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_faber).

I'm just kidding: it's an acronym that
stands for the uninformative sentence _Substitution Failure Is Not An Error_.
Let's take a quick look at what this means.

## SWASEINABT

_(Starting With A Simple Example Is Not A Bad Thing)_

Try to guess what the example below does.

```c++
#include <stdexcept>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

using namespace std; // On small examples, your sins are forgiven

// alias for "return type of T[n]"
template<typename T>
using access_t = decltype(T::operator[](declval<typename T::value_type>()));

// use this if T[n] is a valid expression...
template<typename T, typename = access_t<T>>
typename T::value_type at(const T& container, size_t n) {
    return container[n];
}

// ...otherwise, use this
template<typename T>
typename T::value_type at(const T& container, size_t n) {
    size_t i = 0;
    for(auto it = container.begin(); it != container.end(); ++it) {
        if (i == n) return *it;
        ++i;
    }

    throw runtime_error("Out of bounds");
}

int main() {
    vector<int> a {1, 3, 5, 9, 1, 6};
    list<int> b {1, 4, 0, 8, 7};

    cout << "a[4] == " << at(a, 4)
         << "\nb[2] == " << at(b, 2) << endl;

    // Output:
    // a[4] == 1
    // b[2] == 0
}
```

This code snippet is defining the function `at(container, n)`,
which returns the `n`-th element of `container`. If the container supports
indexing with the `[]` operator, it uses the first version of `at`. Otherwise,
it uses the second version. In C++, `vector`s support `[]`, but `list`s don't,
so we should see both functions being used here.

Let's walk through the tricky bits:
* The `using` declaration at the beginning defines a "metafunction", which in
  this case is really just an alias for the return type of `T::operator[]`.
  [`declval`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/declval)
  is a sort of dummy value, used to evaluate what type
  `T::operator[]` will return. [`decltype`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype)
  evaluates the compile-time type of the expression.

* The signature starting with `template<typename T, typename = access_t<T>>`
  looks strange: why is there a default, unnamed parameter? This
  is really the essence of SFINAE: `access_t<T>` needs to be well-defined, and
  this will only be the case if the type `T` has an `operator[]` function. If it
  doesn't, then _Substitution Failure_ will occurr, however this _Is Not An
  Error_, because there is another `at` function which is well-defined and can
  be used instead.

In C++20 you no longer need the hack with `access_t<T>`: you can use concepts
and contraints to the same effect.

```c++
template<typename T>
concept Indexable = requires(T t) {
    T::operator[];
};

template<Indexable T>
typename T::value_type at(const T& container, size_t n) {
    return container[n];
}

template<typename T>
typename T::value_type at(const T& container, size_t n) {
    size_t i = 0;
    for(auto it = container.begin(); it != container.end(); ++it) {
        if (i == n) return *it;
        ++i;
    }

    throw runtime_error("Out of bounds");
}
```

That's the essence of it. Of course, there is a lot more to SFINAE, from `void_t` to `enable_if`, to
this abstruse example from cppreference.com:

```c++
template<int I>
void div(char(*)[I % 2 == 0] = nullptr)
{
    // this overload is selected when I is even
}
 
template<int I>
void div(char(*)[I % 2 == 1] = nullptr)
{
    // this overload is selected when I is odd
}
```

In fact, I wanted to write a much longer article about SFINAE "from first principles", but 
then realized that
it was slowly turning into a full-blown primer on template metaprogramming that I didn't have
time to write. If you're interested, here's some further reading material.
