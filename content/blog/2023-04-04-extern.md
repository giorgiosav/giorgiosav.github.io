So you're writing C++ and you found a really useful C library that you want to
call from your C++ code. Let's take a look at a simple way to do this and then
how you can shoot yourself in the foot.

## The Happy Way

Let's take a really simple example. You have this directory structure, where
`harmonic` is the name of your C library.

```
.
├── harmonic
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── harmonic.c
│   └── harmonic.h
└── src
    ├── Makefile
    └── main.cpp
```

Here's the C code.

```c
/****************** harmonic.h ******************/

#ifndef HARMONIC_H
#define HARMONIC_H

double harmonic(double a, double b);

#endif


/****************** harmonic.c ******************/

#include <math.h>
#include <float.h>

#include "harmonic.h"

static double safe_inverse(double a) {
    return 1 / (fabs(a) + DBL_EPSILON);
}

double harmonic(double a, double b) {
    return safe_inverse(a) + safe_inverse(b);
}
```

The `harmonic` function computes `1/|a| + 1/|b|`, which is similar to the
[harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean), but not quite. It
uses `DBL_EPSILON` (a very small number) to avoid division by zero.

Now let's write a very simple `Makefile`, without any bells and whistles. Just
for fun, let's create a static library, `libharmonic.a`.

```make
################ harmonic/Makefile ################

libharmonic.a: harmonic.o
	ar rcs libharmonic.a harmonic.o

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f harmonic.o libharmonic.a
```

`harmonic.o` will be built with the implicit rules of `make`. If you type `make`
inside the `harmonic` directory, you should now see the static library
`libharmonic.a`.

Alright, let's write some C++ code that uses this library now.

```c++
/****************** src/main.cpp ******************/

#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
#include "harmonic.h"
}

using std::cout;

int main() {
    double a = 10;
    double b = 20;

    cout << "Result: " << harmonic(a, b) << '\n';
}
```
The `extern "C"` part is used to prevent name mangling by C++. If you don't like
the `#include` directive inside the `extern "C"` block, there are a couple of
alternatives:

- Add `extern "C"` to the C header file and wrap it in `#ifdef
  __cplusplus`/`#endif` directives. This is generally considered ugly,
  because, if the C code is lower-level, it shouldn't "care" whether or not
  it will be called by C++ code. You could argue that this violates the
  [Single-Responsibility
  Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle),
  although I'm sure there are use cases in which it's justified.
- Copy the C header into a C++ header that declares all functions as `extern
  "C"` and only include the C++ header.

What do we expect this code to print? `1/10 + 1/20 == 0.1 + 0.05`, so we should
get `Result: 0.15`.

And now for our `Makefile`. Let's ignore any changes in the
source files of the `harmonic` library, to keep things simple.

```make
##################### src/Makefile #####################
CXX = g++
main: main.cpp ../harmonic/libharmonic.a
	$(CXX) -I ../harmonic/ -L ../harmonic/ -lharmonic -o $@ $^

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f main main.o
	cd ../harmonic && $(MAKE) clean
```

Alright! Type `make`, execute `./main` and you should see the magic happen:
```bash
> ./main
Result: 0.15
```

Now let's see how you can shoot yourself in the foot.


## The Nefarious Way

Suppose your project starts to grow and now you want to compile an intermediate
`main.o` file instead of always recompiling the source `main.cpp` file.
You need to change the `Makefile` to add a dependency on `main.o`.

```make
##################### src/Makefile #####################
CXX = g++
main: main.o ../harmonic/libharmonic.a
	$(CXX) -L ../harmonic/ -lharmonic -o $@ $^
```

If you try to compile this, you will get one of those frustrating linker errors,
complaining about an undefined reference to the `harmonic` function. To fix
this, you need **external linkage**.

In C and C++, you can use the `extern` keyword to specify that a function or
variable is defined somewhere else in the program. In our case, we need to tell
the compiler that the `harmonic` function won't be available to the `main.o`
object file, but it will be defined in the final executable. Let's take an example.

```c++
/****************** src/main.cpp ******************/

#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
    extern double harmonic(double a, double b);
}

using std::cout;

int main() {
    double a = 10;
    double b = 20;

    cout << "Result: " << harmonic(a, b) << '\n';
}
```

The conversation between the compiler and the developer goes more or less like
this:

    Compiler: Hey, uhm... I can't find this "harmonic" function anywhere.

    Developer: Don't worry, it's defined in another file. The linker will find
               it when building the final executable. Trust me.

    Compiler: OK.

... and that's how you fool the compiler!

The `extern` keyword is dangerous, because you are telling the compiler to trust
you, but are you really trustworthy?? What do you think will happen if the
function signature of `harmonic` changes, but the `extern` declaration remains
the same? Let's go do some damage.


```c
/****************** harmonic.h ******************/

#ifndef HARMONIC_H
#define HARMONIC_H

double harmonic(double a, double b, double c);

#endif


/****************** harmonic.c ******************/

#include <math.h>
#include <float.h>

#include "harmonic.h"

static double safe_inverse(double a) {
    return 1 / (fabs(a) + DBL_EPSILON);
}

double harmonic(double a, double b, double c) {
    return safe_inverse(a) + safe_inverse(b) + safe_inverse(c);
}
```

We've just added an extra term, `double c`, to the `harmonic` function, which now
computes `1/|a| + 1/|b| + 1/|c|`. If we leave `main.cpp` as it is, with the
wrong declaration for `harmonic`, will it compile?

... Yes.

And if we run it?

```bash
> ./main
Result: 4.5036e+15
```

There's your gunshot! Intuitively, this happens because
the callee (the `harmonic` function) assumes that the caller (the `main`
function) "prepared" 3 arguments (i.e. placed them in the relevant registers).
`main` thinks that `harmonic`
takes 2 arguments though, so it only prepared 2. The third argument
ends up being uninitialized memory, hence the ridiculous number that gets printed.

To see this in more detail, we can dump the assembly from the `main`
executable using `objdump`. To make things clearer, I changed our variables `a`
and `b` in the `main` function to be `int`s instead of `double`s.

```
<_main>:
                pushq   %rbp
                movq    %rsp, %rbp
                subq    $32, %rsp
                # [...]
                movl    $10, -4(%rbp)     # int a = 10
                movl    $20, -8(%rbp)     # int b = 20
                # [...]
                cvtsi2sdl       -4(%rbp), %xmm0  # convert to double and store
                cvtsi2sdl       -8(%rbp), %xmm1
                movq    %rax, -16(%rbp)
                callq   0x100002fb0 <_harmonic>  # call harmonic
                # [...]
                addq    $32, %rsp
                popq    %rbp
                retq

<_harmonic>:
                pushq   %rbp
                movq    %rsp, %rbp
                subq    $48, %rsp
                movsd   %xmm0, -8(%rbp)   # double a
                movsd   %xmm1, -16(%rbp)  # double b
                movsd   %xmm2, -24(%rbp)  # double c
                movsd   -8(%rbp), %xmm0
                callq   0x100003010 <_safe_inverse>
                movsd   -16(%rbp), %xmm1
                movsd   %xmm0, -32(%rbp)
                movaps  %xmm1, %xmm0
                # [...]
                addq    $48, %rsp
                popq    %rbp
                retq
```

As you can see, the `main` function stores 2 arguments in `xmm0` and
`xmm1`. `harmonic`, however, reads 3 arguments
from `xmm0`, `xmm1` and `xmm2`, so the third argument from `xmm2` will be
uninitialized memory.
