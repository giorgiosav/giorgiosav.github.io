At the moment, I'm working on 2 things:

1. I'm writing a minimal Markdown to HTML converter from scratch in Rust. The long-term
   project is to build a static site generator like Jekyll, without any
   dependencies. I'm starting with the Markdown part.

2. I'm reading _Numerical Linear Algebra_ by Trefethen and Bau and working
   through the exercises. I hope to write some interesting articles once I'm
   done.
