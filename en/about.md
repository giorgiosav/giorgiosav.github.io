I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Electrical Engineering. I work on
performance optimization for analog circuit simulation. I'm interested in
the low-level sphere and I like learning from first principles.

Fun facts: I lived in a bunch of different places (UK, US, Switzerland, Italy,
Mexico). Before engineering ate up my life, I was working towards becoming a
polyglot and spent my free time learning (natural) languages.
