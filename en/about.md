‚ÄºÔ∏è  **Work in progress**: this website is still under construction. ‚ÄºÔ∏è

Welcome to my tiny corner of the Web, this is a blog in which every now and then
I'll try to post articles about tech, computers, programming, etc...

The website is **built by hand** using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). It **doesn't make use of
JavaScript or third party resources**: only genuine home-made code ü§ì. I also
plan to translate all articles manually, so there might be some discrepancies
between the different versions, but that's just the beauty of language.

Shout out to [Contrast Rebellion](https://contrastrebellion.com/) for their
color scheme, which I reused here, hoping that my pages will be legible.
