‼️  **Work in progress** ‼️

I like reading technical books to sharpen my skills, learn new things, etc. This page
is still a work in progress, but I want to collect here a list of recent books I've
read and my impressions after finishing them.

* _Linear Algebra_, by Jim Hefferon ([link](https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/)).

  A well-written book that covers the basics of Linear Algebra. It's very easy
  to read, I especially appreciate the clear language, the many examples and the
  exercises. This is one of those books that provide insight and many "aha"
  moments, but I do wish it covered more advanced topics as well (the last topic
  is Jordan Canonical Form).
